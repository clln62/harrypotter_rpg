You are a senior at the mysterious and mystical Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!
With graduation around the corner and scoring at the top of your class, you cannot wait to share your abilities with the world.
There seems to be something wrong with the school you have come to know over the past seven years.
Students from your class have gone missing, teachers have no explanations for strange occurrences in class, and abnormal sounds come from the walls at night.

You have heard legends of monsters within the depths of your school. A dragon, a basilisk, and a pack of dementors are among the worst to have haunted your school.
With your expert knowledge of the very creatures in the legends you have learned of, it is up to you to save your school!
Become the hero of this story, explore Hogwarts with the utmost haste, but don't be too eager to explore hidden paths, for being unprepared could lead to another student taking your place at the top during graduation.
